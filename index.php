    <h3>About</h3>
    <p>
        I've always believed that storytelling exists in many forms - whether through the lens
        of a camera, the stroke of a pen, or the movement of a body. As a model and writer based
        between New York and London, I've dedicated my career to exploring these intersections
        of narrative and visual art.

        My journey began in Seattle, where I grew up surrounded by both the raw beauty of the
        Pacific Northwest and the works of literary giants that lined my parents' bookshelves.
        This duality shaped my perspective on art and expression, leading me to pursue both
        modeling and writing with equal passion.

        After graduating with a degree in Creative Writing from Columbia University, I dove
        headfirst into both industries, refusing to choose between my loves. Today, I work
        to bridge the gap between visual and written storytelling, bringing a unique
        perspective to both fields.

        When I'm not on set or writing, you'll find me exploring independent bookstores,
        practicing yoga, or working on my upcoming collection of essays about the fashion
        industry's evolution in the digital age.
